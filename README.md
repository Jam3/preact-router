# @jam3/preact-transition-router

This is a fork of [preact-router@2.5.2](https://github.com/developit/preact-router) that integrates with [preact-transition-group](https://github.com/developit/preact-transition-group).

This is used internally by Jam3 — you probably just want to use `preact-router` directly!
